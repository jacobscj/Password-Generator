# Password-Generator

## Description

The third homework assignment was to code the javascript for a password generator. The goal was to generate a random password based on a four pieces of criteria: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. The password length was required to be more than 7 characters and less than 129 characters. 

With the assistance of my tutor, I was able to begin the assignment by generating arrays to store the criteria. Then I moved to prompting the user to tell us how long they want their password to be, followed by prompts asking what they want their password criteria to be. I then stored the arrays into an object that was called in the next function. The next function generated an empty array that was filled in by for loops depending on whether or not the user chose the character.
